	<h2>Great Mathematicians Hear The Music Of Their Formulas</h2>

	<p>
	Few nights a go I was watching <i><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Colors:_Blue">Bleu</a></i> for the third time. <i>Bleu</i> is a french drama directed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Krzysztof_Kie%C5%9Blowski">Krzysztof Kie&#347;lowski</a>, known for its symbolic use of classical music. The protagonist, Julie, wrestles with her &#34;blue&#34; feelings after death of her husband and child. She ultimately finds a way to inner peace through completing her husband's unfinished orchestral composition. There is a scene toward end of the movie in which Julie writes down musical notes while each is played in the background, giving the impression that Julie hears the music in her head as she writes it. This made me wonder if all good musicians hear the music as they read sheets. Do better composers have more acute &#34;inner ear&#34;?

		Quick search on the internet made me realize that famous composers were extremely talented at hearing music in their heads. The most prominent example is Beethoven. Arguably among top 3 classical composers of all time, he became functionally deaf toward end of his life. Even though there are no official medical records of his deafness, by his mid-forties he could no longer publicly perform or carry on spoken conversation. Astonishingly, during this period he continued to produce great compositions. His Symphony Number 9 is among one of them. Ability to synthesize music inside head also works in reverse direction for the most talented composers. Not only they can hear written music in their heads, they can identify every note once they hear them. This rare ability is called <b>Absolute Pitch</b>. As a mathematics enthusiast, I wondered if I can grasp mathematical expressions the same way Beethoven heard music in his head. Do I hear the music of math.

		I don&#39;t hear formals. My math education taught me to solve puzzles. I never learned how to sense and grasp mathematical expressions. I was taught that a math problem is a puzzle and I have a toolbox. In this toolbox I have axioms, theorems, and patterns that I use to break down and solve each problem. I take patterns from solutions to previously solved problems and use them as a hammer to mold a new problem into something I am already familiar, so I can solve it. The only time I care about real meaning of expressions is once at first when I formulate the problem in mathematical language and then in the end, after the problem is solved. What happens in the middle has nothing to do with real world. Hence, I don&#39;t really hear my mathematical work the same way a composer hear notes in his head. Given that math is a language to describe our world, the same as literature or music, why do we fail to learn it as such.

		Today&#39;s mathematical teaching through intuition lacks rigorousness. When I was in elementary school I learned addition by counting my fingers. If I take in to account two fingers and &#34;Add&#34; three more fingers then I'll have five fingers. Addition was simply combining quantities; putting them together. Multiplication was then defined as repeated additions. &#34;2 x 3&#34; means adding 2 to itself 3 times. Even though this definition seems very promising at first, it falls short once negative numbers, fractions, or irrational numbers come to picture. What does &#34;2 x &pi;&#34; really mean? Instead of refining our initial intuitive definition we are usually quick to define new intuitions for cases our old definition does not work. I have asked science and engineering graduates of top schools about universal but intuitive definition of multiplication and in most cases it resulted in a long confusing discussion about different alternatives. When operations become more abstract, such as power function, even PHD students have difficulty. Lack of rigorous definitions makes it hard to &#34;hear&#34; math as we manipulate equations and solve problems. If math is rigorous and it is created as a language for describing our world, why can&#39;t we have a rigorous, comprehensive, and intuitive definition for its basic operations? The answer is that we can.

		Operations in each field of math can be mapped to intuitive definitions that are rigorous. Since definition of operations do not change, at least in each field, and math is simply a way to  describe our world, we should be able to find intuitions that are comprehensive for basic operations and they still apply as we become more complex or abstract with every theorems. For example addition in numbers and geometry is simply translational movement. In one dimension, defining addition as translational movement on number line is a great intuition that works in all cases. Multiplication can be mapped into rotation, stretching, or shrinking. For example multiplying a multi dimensional space by two is equivalent to stretching our space twice its current size away from origin. With these definitions in mind you can look at an equation and see your imaginary world changing, morphing, and dancing the same way Beethoven heard music when sight reading. The hard part is to stay rigorous with these definition. With every theorem we should make sure our definitions still work and if not we should revise. In the process we can learn much more about mathematics and nature of our world than just methodical manipulation of equations. My goal in next series of articles is to explore math with rigorous intuitive definitions. Surprisingly, these definitions have interesting and insightful interpretations in higher level theorems. Explaining Pythagorean theorem or even complex concepts such as Fourier transform with these intuitive constructs is not only cathartic but also very insightful for an engineer or scientist.
